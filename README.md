# module5challenge
Module 5 challenge that includes the development of an agenda. The agenda operates using the time the user is in, blocking out the hours in a day according to whether it has passed or not. There is a save feature that will be recalled even if the page is reloaded. The page states the date at the top of the page. The javascript uses a 12 hour time converter to help with keeping track of their timezone, and then used javascript to make the time blocks vs repeating it in the html.
